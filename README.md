# Portfolio
Previous programming dating back to 2015, I primarily program in Object Oriented languages like Java, but also like C++ and C since I like being closer to the hardware. I'm familiar with both GUI and development frameworks like Swing and OpenGL.

I wish the best for anybody taking time in their day to read this portfolio.
