# Portfolio
Previous programming dating back to 2015, I primarily program in C++ and C since I like being closer to the hardware. 
I care a lot about performance, but can also be practicality, so I try not to let ambitions get in the way of getting work done on time. 
I also have experience in object oriented development with Java and C# and can work within the more object oriented parts of C++. 
I'm familiar with both GUI and development frameworks. GDscript is the scripting language of the Godot engine, which is why it takes up a large part of my work, 
as it is the engine I use for my personal game projects. 

I wish the best for anybody taking time in their day to read this portfolio.
